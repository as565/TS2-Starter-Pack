I recommend installing to the default directories (especially for GRM - that one is still hardcoded to check within Program Files). The game installs in English but the locale can be changed by editing the language code in the game's Registry files.

(WIP.) 
- Automatically gets and installs the latest Starter Pack files from osab, featuring Sims2RPC. 
- Featuring automated Touchup process with a graphical installer.
- Option to automatically download and install Graphics Rules Maker and DXVK.
Sims 2 must not be installed beforehand. Users will need around 25gb of free space to install the game.
