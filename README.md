# Downloader can't grab the link without paid Mediafire (of course), so I am uploading the files to another platform. To fix this in the meantime, you will have to manually download the Standalone .7z Starter Pack and place it in the game install directory.

DXVK is downloaded directly from Github and is subject to a <a rel="license" href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/blob/master/LICENSE">zlib license</a>. Graphics Rules Maker is downloaded directly from SimsNetwork for private usage.

I recommend installing to the default directories (especially for GRM - that one is still hardcoded to check within Program Files). The game installs in English but the locale can be changed by editing the language code in the game's Registry files.

(WIP.) 
- Automatically gets and installs the latest Starter Pack files from osab, featuring Sims2RPC. 
- Featuring automated Touchup process with a graphical installer.
- Downloads and installs Graphics Rules Maker from SimNetwork.
- Option to automatically download and install DXVK. ***(Your system MUST be Vulkan compatible in order to install the DXVK component.)***

Sims 2 should not be installed beforehand. Users will need around 25gb of free space to install the game.

If you don't like any of this for some reason, stick with the <a href="https://www.mediafire.com/file/ejbhtnu8itob4t0/TS2Store_Ultimate_Collection.7z/file">standalone download</a>.
